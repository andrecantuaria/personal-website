# My Personal Website
## Explore my personal website showcasing my fullstack development journey and projects.

As a student, I took on a college project to build my own website. I got the chance to explore 
web development, using HTML and CSS to make it look great and work interactively.
Despite working on this project individually, I also gained knowledge about Git, a tool for tracking 
changes and collaborating with others on projects.
This project wasn't just about creating a website; it taught me how to use Git effectively 
for version control. It was an exciting journey that blended creativity and coding, 
and I'm thrilled to share the result on my website.

This project started as a single-page website, and in the future, I have plans to enhance and expand it.
I'm excited about the possibilities and eager to continue improving it.
